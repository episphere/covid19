# COVID-19 data integration
Open source code and public discussion of COVID-19 data at NIH, live at https://episphere.github.io/covid19 !

There is also a private rep, at https://github.com/episphere/covid19private, but (if you are a rep member) please use it only for what should not be discussed publicly, such as management issues (there is a github project there), governance of sensitive data, etc.
